## Create Evernote notes from Kindle highlights

You love reading your [**Kindle**](https://kindle.amazon.com/), and you make lots of highlights to review later. You also use [**Evernote**](http://evernote.com) to remember... well, just about everything. Now you can easily **save each highlight as a separate note** in Evernote.

# Example

Open a terminal and run... 

    whispernote.py myhighlights.html email@gmail.com gmailpassword user.abc3@m.evernote.com

...where...

1. `myhighlights.html` is a saved file of your highlights from [https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights](https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights "Your Kindle Highlights")
2. `email@gmail.com` is your Gmail account
3. `gmailpassword` is your account password 
4. `user.abc3@m.evernote.com` is your Evernote incoming email address

## Output

Whispernote uses **Gmail** to create a new Evernote note for each highlight in *myhighlights.html*.

Why Gmail? [Read the rationale.](https://github.com/mattnorris/whispernote/wiki/FAQs)

Here is a Mark Twain quote found in the [37signals](http://37signals.com/) book [Rework](http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745):

</p>

## Output Details

The new note consists of two parts. The first part is the highlight itself, along with a link to **open it directly on your Kindle app** and read it in context. If you have [Rework](http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745) on Kindle, **click the "Read more..." link below to try it out!**

> I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.
>
> [Read more at location 1396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002MUAJ2A&location=1396 "Open this highlight on Kindle")

The second part contains a *Highlight ID* and *Batch ID*. If you run **Whispernote** more than once on the same clippings, you can use these IDs to find duplicates.

> Use these unique IDs to search for duplicate notes in Evernote.
>
> - *Highlight ID:* openB002MUAJ2A1396
> -    *Batch ID:* batch20121213212540

Search Evernote for the *Highlight ID* to find duplicate notes, or for the *Batch ID* to find all the notes created in a particular session. 

# Get Started 

## Install

Whispernote is a Python script that uses the [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) parsing library. If you haven't already, [install pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html), then run: 

    pip install BeautifulSoup4 

Download [whispernote.py](https://raw.github.com/mattnorris/whispernote/master/src/whispernote.py). 

## Get Your Highlights

It's recommended that you save a copy of the highlights page you want to process because your Kindle account pages won't load all of your highlights immediately. Instead, you must manually scroll to load more highlights (or use a [plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-scroll/eochlhpceohhhfogfeladaifggikcjhk) to scroll while you get yourself a drink). 

Why not use Kindle's `My Clippings.txt`? [Read the rationale.](https://github.com/mattnorris/whispernote/wiki/FAQs)

### All Highlights

1. Visit [https://kindle.amazon.com](https://kindle.amazon.com). 
2. Click "Your Highlights". 
2. Scroll ALL the way down the page by holding *PgDn* until the page stops loading more highlights, or use a plugin like [Chrome Auto Scroll](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-scroll/eochlhpceohhhfogfeladaifggikcjhk). 
4. Save the page. 

### Highlights from a Single Book

Highlights for individual books are displayed differently, so the approach is slightly different. 

1. Using [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome), visit [https://kindle.amazon.com](https://kindle.amazon.com). 
2. Click "Your Books". 
3. Click on a book title. 
4. Click "View Your Notes & Highlights". 
5. Within the pop-up, scroll down until you see a link to "Load More Notes & Highlights". Click it, then scroll again, repeating until you see "**No** More Notes & Highlights".
6. Right-click and select "Inspect Element". 
7. Right-click on the `html` node in the *Inspector* (starting with `<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:og="http://opengraphprotocol.org/schema/"...`) and select "Copy as HTML". 
8. Open a text editor.
9. Paste the copied text. 
10. Save the file.
